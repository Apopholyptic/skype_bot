Let’s start the newsletter off with some CTL business. For those of us who are veterans of the team we all the new season is starting next week! And all the fun and glory (and not heartbreak, I’m fucking serious guys, no heartbreak this time) that entails! Basically a tl;dr for the new folks to the team is that we play for a few weeks in the group stage, attain a favorable rating from beating on those scrub teams, and then make it to playoffs where, for many of us, the real season starts. Our first match of the season is against formless gaming. They’ve had like five gabillion different names while they’ve been in the CTL but as Hitl- um - Tbham said, they’ve never beaten us. And we’re gonna keep it that way. Unfortunately the unstoppable freight gold train that is Cobaltt (fuck I love that guy) won’t be playing next week as formless is only able to field plats and diamonds. So if you’re a silver or gold player, sorry dude, you’ll get your shot the week after. Next we move on to some team business - namely changes in the leadership organization of the team. Mahavishnu has elected not to continue on as assistant captain this season. Maha helped the team last season while Padula was busy getting married by putting out weekly line ups and making sure the team was represented. Were it not for Maha’s hard work we would have never been able to make it to the play offs as his strong performances in his matches, in addition to his clutch leadership, was an invaluable asset to the team. If you could all take a moment to thank him for his work the next time you see him on Skype that would be ballin’. To take Maha’s place we have two extremely amicable and competent individuals - Chaos, and Polar. Chaos is a diamond zerg on the team that consistently goes above and beyond for the team. Whether this is corralling new zergies and providing them with build orders, or straight up making a team website (SHAMELESS NEW TEAM WEBSITE PLUG HERE, PLEASE GO TO IT AND REGISTER). Polar is also a veteran of the team in the diamond league. He plays protoss though. He’s a nice guy in spite of that though, and a true treat to play with in scrims or interact with in Skype chat. Both Chaos and Polar have been representatives of the team on the small council and are continuing the natural progression into the assistant captain positions. They should have no problems in capability and should bring much needed insight into map picks, strategy, and team unity. Next, we’re going to talk about fight night. As TBham said, we are a “highly organized team.” Apparently. However, we’ve historically struggled with fielding our best when we have such a diverse and strong bevy of individuals to choose from. Fight night has evolved to address this need and the matches are designed to gauge where you stack up against other players in your league and will help us to determine who to field for our CTL matches. Thus it’s important that you play your fight night matches, because if you don’t, and you’re interested in being fielded for the CTL matches, you may be passed up for a player that has proven their worth on the fields of Starcraft justice. That said, due to the pro league style of CTL matches, and the initial Bo5 format for fight night there has been some mixed opinions on the formatting of this team event. Some of our strongest CTL performers are consummate cheesers, and some are die-hard macroers. We’re setting up a poll for you to vote on the format - should it be changed to a Bo3 format? Or should it remain a Bo5 format? Sound off in the poll, and maybe the comments below if you’re so inclined. Obligatory mandatory meeting copypasta paragraph - “There will be a mandatory beginning of the season meeting on October Sunday the 12 at 8 Eastern Standard time (EST). If you cannot make it please message Padula asap with why you will be unable to attend. I know this is an unfriendly EU time but please try to do your best to make it. I expect all active members to attend this meeting for we will be discussing and voting on numerous things as well as talking about expectations for the year. Lets get that championship boys.” Obligatory message imploring you to vote on the activity requirement for the new season. Our team position is 8, but you can vote however you wish to. But that is the current team position if you need a point of reference.
